# NetSynth
---

## What is it?

NetSynth is a simplified synthisizer designed to play music over a network.

## How do I even?

The program comes with two executables, Client and Server, the server can be run on a single computer, and anyone with the Client can connect to it.

### Connecting

The server can accept clients from anywhere:

- Your own computer (127.0.0.1)
- Any computers on the network (Using an internal IP)
- Any computers over the internet (Using an external IP)
	- Note that NetSynth wasn't designed to be used over internet and as such, clients do not produce audio.

### Playing

Use the letters on your keyboard to play notes. Your home row plays notes from the selected octave, the top row plays an octave higher, and the bottom row plays an octave lower.

## Requirements

[Visual C++ 2013 Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40784 "Visual C++ 2013 Runtime Download")
